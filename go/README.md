# Tool builder: `gcr.io/cloud-builders/go`

This Cloud Build step runs the `go` tool.

### When to use this builder

The `gcr.io/cloud-builders/go` build step should be used when you want to run
the `go` tool directly on your source, similar to how a developer uses the `go`
tool locally to build (`go build` or `go install`), test (`go test`), or manage
source (`go get` or `go generate`).

### `alpine` vs `debian`

There are two supported versions of this builder, one for `alpine` and one for
`debian`. The difference is significant since, by default, Go dynamically links
libc. Binaries built in an `alpine` environment don't always work in a
`debian`-like (including `ubuntu`, etc) environment, or vice versa.

The specific versions are available as

-   gcr.io/cloud-builders/go:alpine
-   gcr.io/cloud-builders/go:debian

And `gcr.io/cloud-builders/go:latest` is an alias for
`gcr.io/cloud-builders/go:alpine`.

## Workspace setup

Before the `go` tool is used, the build step first sets up a workspace.

To determine the workspace structure, this tool checks the following, in order:

1.  Is `$GOPATH` set? Use that.
2.  Is there a `./src` directory? Set `GOPATH=$PWD`.
3.  Is `$PROJECT_ROOT` set? Make a temporary workspace in `GOPATH=./gopath`, and
    link the contents of the current directory into
    `./gopath/src/$PROJECT_ROOT/*`.
4.  Does a `.go` file in the current directory have a comment like `// import
    "$PROJECT_ROOT"`? Use the `$PROJECT_ROOT` found in the import comment
    instead of a provided `$PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable.

Once the workspace is set up, the `args` to the build step are passed through to
the `go` tool.

This tool builder sets `CGO_ENABLED=0`, so that all binaries are linked
statically.

## Output files

The binaries built by a `go install` step will be available to subsequent build
steps.

If you use the `install` subcommand, the binaries will end up in `$GOPATH/bin`.

*   If you set `$GOPATH`, the binaries will end up in `$GOPATH/bin`.
*   If you rely on `./src` to indicate the workspace, the binaries will end up
    in `./bin`.
*   If you use `$PROJECT_ROOT` or an `//import` comment, the binaries will end
    up in `./gopath/bin`.

## Examples

-   [Hello, World!](examples/hello_world) is a basic example that builds a
    binary that is injected into a container image. It uses the `$PROJECT_ROOT`
    method to define its workspace.
-   [Whole workspace](examples/whole_workspace) is the same as the "Hello,
    World!" example, except that it uses the `./src` method to define its
    workspace.

## Building this builder

To build this builder, run the following command in this directory.
