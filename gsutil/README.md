# gsutil

This is a tool builder to simply invoke
[`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) commands.

Arguments passed to this builder will be passed to `gsutil` directly, allowing
callers to run
[any `gsutil` command](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil).

When executed in the Cloud Build environment, commands are executed with
credentials of the
[builder service account](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/permissions)
for the project.

The latest available version of `gsutil` is used.

## Examples

For these to work, the builder service account must have permission to access
the necessary buckets and objects.
