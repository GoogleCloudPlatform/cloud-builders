Contributor License Agreements
------------------------------

Before we can accept your pull requests you'll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA):

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).

* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate>).

You can sign these electronically (just scroll to the bottom). After that, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.
