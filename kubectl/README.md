# Tool builder: `gcr.io/cloud-builders/kubectl`

This build step runs
[`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/).

## Using this builder with Google Kubernetes Engine

To use this builder, your
[builder service account](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/how-to/service-account-permissions)
will need IAM permissions sufficient for the operations you want to perform. For
typical read-only usage, the "Kubernetes Engine Viewer" role is sufficient. To
deploy container images on a GKE cluster, the "Kubernetes Engine Developer" role
is sufficient. Check the
[GKE IAM page](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/iam-integration)
for details.

Running the following command will give Cloud Build Service Account
`container.developer` role access to your Kubernetes Engine clusters:

```sh
PROJECT="$(gcloud projects describe \
    $(gcloud config get-value core/project -q) --format='get(projectNumber)')"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
    --member=serviceAccount:$PROJECT@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role=roles/container.developer
```

For most use, kubectl will need to be configured to point to a specific GKE
cluster. You can configure the cluster by setting environment variables.

    CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE=<your cluster's zone>
    CLOUDSDK_CONTAINER_CLUSTER=<your cluster's name>

If your GKE cluster is in a different project than Cloud Build, also set:

`CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=<the GKE cluster project>`

Make sure you also grant the Cloud Build service account permissions in the GKE
cluster project.


Setting the environment variables above will cause this step's entrypoint to
first run a command to fetch cluster credentials as follows.

    gcloud container clusters get-credentials --zone "$CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE" "$CLOUDSDK_CONTAINER_CLUSTER"

Then, `kubectl` will have the configuration needed to talk to your GKE cluster.

## Building this builder

To build this builder, run the following command in this directory.

    $ gcloud builds submit . --config=cloudbuild.yaml
